# Multigres RFCs

This directory contains Request for Comments (RFC) documents for Multigres. RFCs are design documents that describe new features, architectural changes, or process improvements for the Multigres project.

## Purpose

RFCs serve to:
- Document design decisions and technical rationale
- Facilitate collaborative design and review
- Provide historical context for future development
- Ensure consistent architecture and implementation approaches

## When to Write an RFC

Consider writing an RFC for:
- New major features or components
- Significant architectural changes
- Breaking changes to APIs or protocols
- Changes that affect multiple components
- Complex implementation decisions that need community input

## RFC Process

1. **Draft**: Create a new RFC using the template (see RFC-0000)
2. **Review**: Share with the team for feedback and iteration
3. **Discussion**: Address feedback and refine the proposal
4. **Decision**: RFC is accepted, rejected, or requires further iteration
5. **Implementation**: If accepted, implementation can begin
6. **Archive**: Completed RFCs are kept for historical reference
