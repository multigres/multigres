# Working with us

Our goal is to build a thriving community around Multigres. So, we welcome participation of any kind. At this point, we don't have a dedicated slack or discord channel.

## Discussions

If you have questions or would like to start a discussion about a topic, you can [start a discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/multigres/multigres/discussions). We look forward to your participation.

## Issues

If you see something broken, you can [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/multigres/multigres/issues).

## Proposals

If you'd like to propose a change, you can file an issue. If the proposal is a major change, you can file an issue with `RFC: <proposal>` on the subject line.

## Cosmetic changes

If you'd like to submit a minor pull request, you can submit one by following the [Github Workflow](./workflow.md).
