# Brainstorms

This directory contains lightweight design documents, discussion notes, and brainstorming sessions for Multigres. These are more informal than full RFCs and serve to capture ideas, decisions, and thought processes.

## Purpose

Brainstorms are used for:
- Capturing design discussions and decisions
- Documenting vision and direction
- Exploring ideas before they become formal RFCs
- Recording architectural thinking and rationale
- Sharing informal design proposals

## Format

Brainstorms are intentionally flexible in format. Common patterns include:
- **Vision documents**: High-level direction and goals
- **Design explorations**: Multiple approaches to a problem
- **Decision records**: Why we chose a particular approach
- **Research notes**: Analysis of existing solutions
- **Discussion summaries**: Key points from design meetings

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names that make the content clear:
- `[date]-document-name.md`
