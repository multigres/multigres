# Multigres - Vitess for Postgres

Welcome to Multigres! A horizontally scalable Postgres architecture that supports multi-tenant, highly-available and globally distributed deployments, all while staying true to standard Postgres.


The project is in its very early stages and is maintained by engineers at [supabase.io](https://supabase.io). You can read the announcement [here](https://supabase.com/blog/multigres-vitess-for-postgres). We are working hard to deliver a working MVP as soon as possible and are excited to share our progress.

To learn more, visit the official  [website](https://multigres.com/) where you can explore the architecture overview and early documentation.
