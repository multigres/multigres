# PostgreSQL Client Authentication Configuration File
# ===================================================
#
# Generated by Multigres - Helping you Scale PostgreSQL
#
# This file controls: which hosts are allowed to connect, how clients
# are authenticated, which PostgreSQL user names they can use, which
# databases they can access. Records take one of these forms:
#
# local      DATABASE  USER  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# host       DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# hostssl    DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# hostnossl  DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             {{.User}}       trust
local   all             all             peer

# Replication connections (localhost only)
local   replication     all                                     trust
host    replication     all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
host    replication     all             ::1/128                 trust

# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256
host    all             all             ::1/128                 scram-sha-256

# IPv4 external connections
host    all             all             10.0.0.0/8              scram-sha-256
host    all             all             172.16.0.0/12           scram-sha-256
host    all             all             192.168.0.0/16          scram-sha-256
host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0               scram-sha-256

# IPv6 external connections
host    all             all             ::0/0                   scram-sha-256
