# Completed Phases - PostgreSQL Parser Port

This document tracks major milestones and completed phases of the PostgreSQL parser port project.

## Phase 0: Planning âœ… COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2025-07-18 (Session 001)  
**Duration**: 1 session

### What Was Delivered:
- [x] Comprehensive project plan with 5 development phases
- [x] Project structure design following Vitess patterns  
- [x] Technical requirements and success criteria defined
- [x] Documentation system for multi-session work established
- [x] PostgreSQL parser analysis completed
- [x] Vitess parser pattern analysis completed

### Key Decisions Made:
- Use goyacc for parser generation (following Vitess)
- All Go code under `go/` directory structure
- Thread-safe design with explicit context (no global state)
- Test-driven compatibility approach (100% PostgreSQL compatibility)
- Session-based documentation for long-term project

### Artifacts Created:
- `project_plan.md` - Master engineering plan
- `progress/current_status.md` - Status tracking system
- `progress/completed_phases.md` - This document
- `README.md` - Project overview and quick start guide

## Phase 1: Foundation ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Started**: TBD  
**Target Completion**: TBD

### Planned Deliverables:
- [ ] Go module structure and setup
- [ ] Basic Makefile with parser generation rules
- [ ] Keywords and tokens from PostgreSQL
- [ ] AST node definitions
- [ ] Thread-safe parser context system
- [ ] Basic test framework

### Progress:
*Status will be updated as work progresses*

## Phase 2: Lexer ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
**Target Start**: After Phase 1 completion

### Planned Deliverables:
- [ ] Lexical analysis implementation (scan.l port)
- [ ] Token generation system
- [ ] String and escape handling (scansup.c port)
- [ ] Thread-safe error reporting
- [ ] Comprehensive lexer tests

---

## Phase 3: Grammar & Parsing ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
**Target Start**: After Phase 2 completion

### Planned Deliverables:
- [ ] Grammar file port (gram.y to postgres.y)
- [ ] Goyacc integration and build system
- [ ] Parse tree construction
- [ ] Source location tracking
- [ ] Generated parser validation

---

## Phase 4: Semantic Analysis ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
**Target Start**: After Phase 3 completion

### Planned Deliverables:
- [ ] Semantic analysis system (analyze.c port)
- [ ] Expression analysis modules
- [ ] Clause handling systems
- [ ] Type system implementation
- [ ] Advanced SQL features (CTEs, MERGE, etc.)

---

## Phase 5: Testing & Validation ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
**Target Start**: After Phase 4 completion

### Planned Deliverables:
- [ ] Unit test suite
- [ ] PostgreSQL regression test port
- [ ] Compatibility validation system
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Fuzzing and robustness tests

---

## Success Metrics Tracking

### Overall Project Goals:
- [ ] Parse all PostgreSQL syntax supported by original parser
- [ ] Thread-safe: multiple goroutines can parse concurrently  
- [ ] Compatibility: 100% test compatibility with PostgreSQL regression tests
- [ ] Maintainable: Clear Go idioms, comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Generated Code: Reproducible parser generation using Makefile

### Quality Gates:
- [ ] Each phase has comprehensive tests
- [ ] Code review and documentation for each phase
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Memory safety validated
- [ ] Concurrent usage validated
