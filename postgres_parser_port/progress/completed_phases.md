# Completed Phases - PostgreSQL Parser Port

This document tracks major milestones and completed phases of the PostgreSQL parser port project.

## Phase 0: Planning âœ… COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2025-07-18 (Session 001)  
**Duration**: 1 session

### What Was Delivered:
- [x] Comprehensive project plan with 5 development phases
- [x] Project structure design following Vitess patterns  
- [x] Technical requirements and success criteria defined
- [x] Documentation system for multi-session work established
- [x] PostgreSQL parser analysis completed
- [x] Vitess parser pattern analysis completed

### Key Decisions Made:
- Use goyacc for parser generation (following Vitess)
- All Go code under `go/` directory structure
- Thread-safe design with explicit context (no global state)
- Test-driven compatibility approach (100% PostgreSQL compatibility)
- Session-based documentation for long-term project

### Artifacts Created:
- `project_plan.md` - Master engineering plan
- `progress/current_status.md` - Status tracking system
- `progress/completed_phases.md` - This document
- `README.md` - Project overview and quick start guide

## Phase 1: Foundation âœ… COMPLETED
**Started**: 2025-07-21 (Session 002)  
**Completed**: 2025-07-21 (Session 002)
**Duration**: 1 session (~2 hours)

### Delivered Results:
- [x] Go module structure and setup
- [x] Comprehensive Makefile with parser generation rules
- [x] Complete keywords and tokens system from PostgreSQL
- [x] Basic AST node framework (foundation for 535 total nodes)
- [x] Thread-safe parser context system
- [x] Production-ready test framework with PostgreSQL integration

### Key Achievements:
- **Thread-Safe Design**: Eliminated all PostgreSQL global state
- **PostgreSQL Compatibility**: Keywords validated against actual PostgreSQL source
- **Test Coverage**: 100% pass rate across all components (keywords, AST, context, testutils)
- **Build System**: Professional Makefile with 23 targets for development/CI
- **Source Traceability**: All code includes PostgreSQL source references

### Critical Discovery:
**AST Scope Underestimate**: PostgreSQL has 535 AST struct definitions, but Phase 1 only implemented ~15 basic nodes. This necessitates Phase 1.5 for complete AST implementation.

## Phase 1.5: Complete AST Implementation ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Started**: TBD (Next Session)  
**Target Completion**: TBD

### Planned Deliverables:
- [ ] Complete PostgreSQL AST node analysis (535 total structs)
- [ ] All statement nodes from `parsenodes.h` (~196 structs)
- [ ] All expression nodes from `primnodes.h` (~64 structs)
- [ ] All support nodes from `value.h`, `miscnodes.h` (~275 structs)
- [ ] Enhanced node traversal system supporting all types
- [ ] Comprehensive AST test suite covering all node types

### Scope Breakdown:
**Parse Nodes** (`parsenodes.h` - 196 structs):
- DDL statements (CREATE, ALTER, DROP variants)
- DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE variants) 
- Utility statements (VACUUM, ANALYZE, EXPLAIN, etc.)
- Transaction and session control statements

**Expression Nodes** (`primnodes.h` - 64 structs):
- Function expressions (FuncExpr, Aggref, WindowFunc)
- Operator expressions (OpExpr, BoolExpr, NullTest)
- Literal expressions (Const, Param, various literal types)
- Reference expressions (Var, FieldSelect, SubLink)

**Support Nodes** (other files - ~275 structs):
- Value nodes, list structures, type definitions
- Miscellaneous nodes for specialized functionality

### Progress:
*Status will be updated as implementation progresses*

## Phase 2: Lexer ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
**Target Start**: After Phase 1 completion

### Planned Deliverables:
- [ ] Lexical analysis implementation (scan.l port)
- [ ] Token generation system
- [ ] String and escape handling (scansup.c port)
- [ ] Thread-safe error reporting
- [ ] Comprehensive lexer tests

---

## Phase 3: Grammar & Parsing ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
**Target Start**: After Phase 2 completion

### Planned Deliverables:
- [ ] Grammar file port (gram.y to postgres.y)
- [ ] Goyacc integration and build system
- [ ] Parse tree construction
- [ ] Source location tracking
- [ ] Generated parser validation

---

## Phase 4: Semantic Analysis ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
**Target Start**: After Phase 3 completion

### Planned Deliverables:
- [ ] Semantic analysis system (analyze.c port)
- [ ] Expression analysis modules
- [ ] Clause handling systems
- [ ] Type system implementation
- [ ] Advanced SQL features (CTEs, MERGE, etc.)

---

## Phase 5: Testing & Validation ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
**Target Start**: After Phase 4 completion

### Planned Deliverables:
- [ ] Unit test suite
- [ ] PostgreSQL regression test port
- [ ] Compatibility validation system
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Fuzzing and robustness tests

---

## Success Metrics Tracking

### Overall Project Goals:
- [ ] Parse all PostgreSQL syntax supported by original parser
- [ ] Thread-safe: multiple goroutines can parse concurrently  
- [ ] Compatibility: 100% test compatibility with PostgreSQL regression tests
- [ ] Maintainable: Clear Go idioms, comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Generated Code: Reproducible parser generation using Makefile

### Quality Gates:
- [ ] Each phase has comprehensive tests
- [ ] Code review and documentation for each phase
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Memory safety validated
- [ ] Concurrent usage validated
