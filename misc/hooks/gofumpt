# Exit if no Go files to process

# Check for unformatted files

# Exit if all files are already formatted
[ -z "$unformatted" ] && exit 0

# Some files need formatting - format them and re-stage
echo "Formatting Go files..."

# Deduplicate files first in case a file has multiple errors

  # Split the "gofumpt" output on newlines only
